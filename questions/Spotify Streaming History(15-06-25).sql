/*
Problem: Cumulative Song Plays up to August 4th, 2022

You are given two tables containing Spotify usersâ€™ streaming data:

songs_history: Contains historical play counts for each user-song combination up to July 31st, 2022.

songs_weekly: Contains timestamped streaming events for the week of August 1st to August 7th, 2022.

Your task is to write a SQL query that outputs the cumulative number of times each user played each song up to and including August 4th, 2022.
